unBox
=====

An attempt at a small, lightweight, responsive, mobile friendly, library-agnostic lightbox. Originally a [**Rebox**](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/jQuery-Rebox/) fork, but restarted from scratch with ideas loosely based on Rebox. Currently in research and development.

Even though the code is pretty much pre-release, I'm confident enough to use it in my projects.

## What works?
- images
- local videos (not extensively tested)
- YouNoob videos (not extensively tested)

## What is intended to work?
- Gurgle maps
- videos from other popular services

## How to use it?
- download the repo
- grab files `unbox.js`, `unbox.css` and include them in your project
- take a peak at `unbox.html` on how it's used
